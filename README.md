      - ./docker/posterr/custom:/usr/src/app/public/custom
    ports:
      - 9876:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
```
#### Details
|Option|Details|
|--|--|
|TZ|Your local timezone. Go to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and use the `TZ Database Name` value.|
|/docker/posterr/config|This is required to save your Posterr settings|
|/docker/posterr/custom|This is required for custom pictures (and other custom media in the future)|
|Ports|Change first part to a different port if needed. e.g. 9876:3000|
|BASEPATH|_"/path"_ Use this for reverse proxy setups which require a base path value. **This line can be left out, or value left blank** if you dont use alternate paths. |

### <ins>Unraid</ins>
 - Use the Posterr template in community apps. (Being replaced with new version)

---
## Updates
 - From v1.10.1, there will be a notice at the top of the settings screen informing you if you are running an old version. 
 - Use containrr/watchtower to auto-update Posterr in Docker environments
 - Update in the usual way for Unraid

---
## Setup
Get to the settings page in a number of ways:
 - On initial load, you will be prompted.
 - Change the URL to _'http://hostIP:9876/settings'_ (where `hostIP` is the IP number of the machine that Posterr is installed on. Change the port number if you set a different value. 3000 is the default for the binary executables)
 - Clicking on the top banner title of any slide.
 - If on the 'no content' page, then click this text

*The default password is:* **raidisnotabackup**

## Possible Uses
 - Mount a monitor on your wall and showcase your home media setup
 - Use it on a second monitor to keep an eye on what is running
 - Run it on a small screen mounted outside your theater room to show when a movie is in progress
 - Use a reverse proxy, or port-forward, to let your friends see what is playing, available, and coming soon
